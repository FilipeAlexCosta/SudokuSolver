Trying my hand at making a sudoku solver. I've done this before in python,
however it was poorly optimized and terribly written seeing as it was my first project.

I'll be trying to make most if not everything myself, if something is not original I'll mention it
and it will probably come from this playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkTXsX7igf8edTYU92nU-f5Ntzuf-RKvW
